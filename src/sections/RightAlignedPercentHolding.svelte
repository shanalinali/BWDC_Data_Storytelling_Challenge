        Education loans are typically fixed and accrue interest‚Äîa consistent
        detractor of wealth‚Äîwhile stocks are an unpredictable source of wealth.
        <br /><br />Black and Hispanic households are then at a
        <u>higher financial risk</u>
        when they decide to pursue higher education.
        <br /><br />They do not have the generational wealth or median net
        worth, as established by previous visualizations, to easily make that
        decision.

      <ArticleText>
        <strong>So many factors</strong> play into whether students, workers, or
        households are likely to take out loans to further their education.
        <br /><br />And when the job market does not readily guarentee a job
        after graduation, the risk in taking on debt for education increases.
        <br /><br />Instead of improving one's chances at wealth, education
        could hurt it.
