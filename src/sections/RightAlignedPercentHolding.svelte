        <strong>Wealthier households</strong> have a stronger capability to take on financial risks.
      </ArticleText>

      <ArticleText>
        <strong>From 2019 to 2022,</strong> the percent of White and Other race households with stock holdings <u>grew</u>.
        <br /><br /> At the same time, the percentage of these households with education loans <u>fell</u>. <br /><br />
        <ObservedArticleText {callback} {options}>
          <strong>Negative correlation</strong>‚Äîmeaning that stock assets increased while education debts decreased for these households.

        <strong>Again, this trend is different</strong> for Black and Hispanic households.
      </ArticleText>

      <ArticleText>
       <strong>From 2019 to 2022,</strong> the percentage of Black and Hispanic households with stock holdings increased, but <u>so did the percentage of these households with education loans</u>.
       <ObservedArticleText {callback} {options}>
        <strong>Positive correlation</strong>‚Äîstock assests and education debts both increased. 
       </ObservedArticleText>
      </ArticleText>

      <ArticleText>
        Education loans are typically fixed and accrue interest‚Äîa consistent detractor of wealth‚Äîwhile stocks are an unpredictable source of wealth.
        <br /><br />Black and Hispanic households are then at a <u>higher financial risk</u> when they decide to pursue higher education.
        <br /><br />They do not have the generational wealth or median net worth, as established by previous visualizations, to easily make that decision.
      </ArticleText>

      <ArticleText>
        <strong>So many factors</strong> play into whether students, workers, or households are likely to take out loans to further their education. 
        <br /><br />And when the job market does not readily guarentee a job after graduation, the risk in taking on debt for education increases. 
        <br /><br />Instead of improving one's chances at wealth, education could hurt it.
